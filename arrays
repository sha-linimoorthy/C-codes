Vinay loves to play with numbers. He will give a matrix to his friends and they have to find the saddle point in it. Write a program to obtain a square matrix and find the saddle point in it.



Note : Saddle point is an element in the matrix which is minimum in its row and maximum in its column.

Input format
The first line of the input consists of the n value that is the order of the matrix.

The second line consists of the matrix elements separated by a space.

Output format
The output prints the saddle point along with its position or no saddle point.

Code constraints
Input consists of square matrix only.

Sample testcases
Input 1
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Output 1
Saddle point is in (2,0) and the value is 7
